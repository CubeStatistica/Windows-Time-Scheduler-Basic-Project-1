1. Have added batch file that runs the python production code script.

2. Now create task in Task scheduler to run the batch file every day at with one 1 interval. Hopefully this is not too many times and does not break something like the csv file. Hopefully not since it is a csv file and an excel file.

**Note.** Issue in the batch file. Need to write the entire path to the python script file for the batch to run. Not just the name of the python scipt file.

3. Corrected the above and added a column in the dataset with the number of rows added when the script ran.
